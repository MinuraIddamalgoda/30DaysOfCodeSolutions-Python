# 30DaysOfCodeSolutions-Python

I have found many solutions to HackerRank's 30 Days Of Code challenges online.
 However, I have yet to find one that _explains_ the code as opposed to simply
 giving the answer. 
 
Through this repo, I aim to impart a deeper level of understanding to beginners 
so that they understand why we do what we do.
